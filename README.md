The "CIDgravity connector" connects a lotus-miner to the CIDgravity service. 
This lighweight connector is executed locally by the lotus-miner process each time the lotus-miner receives a deal proposal.

# Requirements 
1. Get a CIDgravity account (contact@cidgravity.com)
2. Set your get-ask prices to 0 and size to the widest range : 
```
lotus-miner storage-deals set-ask --price 0 --verified-price 0 --min-piece-size 256 --max-piece-size MINER_SEC_SIZE
```
3. Install python modules : toml and requests
```
sudo apt install python3-toml python3-requests
```

# Get Started
```
# INSTALL THE CONNECTOR
sudo -i -u USER_RUNNING_LOTUS_MINER_PROCESS
git clone https://github.com/CIDgravity/CIDgravity-X.git
cd CIDgravity-X

# EDIT THE CONFIG FILE : ADD TOKEN AND LOGFILE LOCATION
nano ./cidgravity_storage_connector.toml

# EXECUTE THE CHECK PROCESS 
./cidgravity_storage_connector.py --check

#Â ENABLE "CIDgravity connector" IN LOTUS-MINER by adding the following line to .lotusminer/config.toml
Filter = "ABSOLUTE_PATH/cidgravity_storage_connector.py --accept"

# RESTART THE MINER

# DONE :) you can now enjoy CIDgravity
```
